If we have one for pluto, we should have one for the other dwarf planets.

Eris has an apparent magnitude of 18.7, making it bright enough to be detectable to some amateur telescopes. A 200-millimeter (7.9 in) telescope with a CCD can detect Eris under favorable conditions.

Eris is named after the Greek goddess of strife and discord.
It's a little more massive than Pluto, and it's also the largest body
orbiting the Sun that we haven't sent a spacecraft to.

Hopefully it's not mad at us for not visiting.
